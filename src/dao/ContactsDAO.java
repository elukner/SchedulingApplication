/**
 *The dao package will hold Utility Classes that handle Database Access.
 *
 * Defining DAO or Abstract classes with static methods
 * that perform CRUD (Create Read Update Delete)
 * or INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE,
 * and DELETE operations is highly recommended. For
 * more info on the DAO pattern
 *
 * These classes interact with the database,
 * perform CRUD operations, and handle data retrieval.
 *
 * Responsibility: The dao package primarily focuses on encapsulating
 * the logic associated with database interactions.
 *
 * Purpose: It contains classes responsible for database-related operations,
 * such as CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
 * operations, querying the database, and managing
 * data retrieval and storage.
 *
 * Components: Typically includes classes that abstract
 * database operations, handle connections, execute queries,
 * and perform data manipulation.
 *
 * Usage: DAO classes are specific to interacting with your
 * database tables/entities. They map Java objects to
 * database entities and handle the
 * interaction between the application and the database.
