package helper;

/**
 * And the helper package will hold helper classes
 * that handle tasks such as
 * Date / Time processing, List management, etc.
 *
 * Add a utility or utils package to hold
 * classes for your; Database Connection,
 * Query Execution, Collection (ObservarbleArrayList)
 * Management, Functional Interfaces, and time conversion files.
 *
 * Responsibility: The helper package houses utility
 * classes that provide generic functionalities
 * and support tasks that
 * are not directly related to database operations.
 *
 * Purpose: It contains classes that offer assistance
 * across various parts of the application but aren't
 * tied explicitly to database interactions.
 *
 * Components: Includes classes that handle
 * general tasks like date/time conversions,
 * file I/O operations, collection management,
 * and other utility functions that facilitate
 * different aspects of the application.
 *
 * Usage: Helper classes are not tied to a
 * specific data entity or database operation.
 * They offer reusable functionalities across
 * different parts of the application, providing
 * support to other components.
 *
 * Database Connection: Managing connections, executing queries,
 * and handling database-related tasks that don't fit directly
 * within DAO classes.
 *
 * Date/Time Operations: Conversions between different time zones,
 * date formatting, or any other date/time-related functionalities.
 *
 * File I/O: Reading from and writing to files,
 * managing file-related operations.
 *
 * Collection Management: Utility methods for managing collections,
 * lists, or other data structures efficiently.
 *
 * Other General Utilities: Any other functions that offer
 * support across different parts of the application
 * but don't specifically belong to the DAO or controller logic.
 *
 * If you have utility classes containing functional interfaces,
 * you can employ lambda expressions to implement
 * these interfaces and enhance their usage.
 *
 * // Example of using a functional interface in a helper class method
 * public class TimeConversionUtil {
 *     public void performOperation(OperationInterface operation) {
 *         operation.execute();
 *     }
 *
 *     public void useLambda() {
 *         // Using lambda expression to implement the functional interface
 *         performOperation(() -> System.out.println("Performing operation using lambda"));
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * @FunctionalInterface
 * interface OperationInterface {
 *     void execute();
 * }
 *

/**
 * Write code that provides the ability to track user activity by recording all user log-in attempts, dates, and
 * time stamps and whether each attempt was successful in a file named login_activity.txt.
 * Append each new record to the existing file, and save to the root folder of the application.
