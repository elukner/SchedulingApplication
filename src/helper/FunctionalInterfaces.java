/**
 * And the helper package will hold helper classes
 * that handle tasks such as
 * Date / Time processing, List management, etc.
 *
 * Add a utility or utils package to hold
 * classes for your; Database Connection,
 * Query Execution, Collection (ObservarbleArrayList)
 * Management, Functional Interfaces, and time conversion files.
 *
 * Other General Utilities: Any other functions that offer
 * support across different parts of the application
 * but don't specifically belong to the DAO or controller logic.
 *
 * If you have utility classes containing functional interfaces,
 * you can employ lambda expressions to implement
 * these interfaces and enhance their usage.
 *
 * // Example of using a functional interface in a helper class method
 * public class TimeConversionUtil {
 *     public void performOperation(OperationInterface operation) {
 *         operation.execute();
 *     }
 *
 *     public void useLambda() {
 *         // Using lambda expression to implement the functional interface
 *         performOperation(() -> System.out.println("Performing operation using lambda"));
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * @FunctionalInterface
 * interface OperationInterface {
 *     void execute();
